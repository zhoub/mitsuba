\subsection{Sensors}
\label{sec:sensors}
In Mitsuba, \emph{sensors}, along with a \emph{film}, are responsible for recording radiance
measurements in some usable format. This includes default choices such as perspective
or orthographic cameras, as well as more specialized sensors that measure the radiance
into a given direction or the irradiance received by a certain surface. The following
section lists the available choices.

\subsubsection*{Handedness convention}
Sensors in Mitsuba are \emph{right-handed}.
Any number of rotations and translations can be applied to them
without changing this property. By default they are located at the
origin and oriented in such a way that in the rendered image, $+X$ points left,
$+Y$ points upwards, and $+Z$ points along the viewing direction.

Left-handed sensors are also supported. To switch the handedness,
flip any one of the axes, e.g. by passing a scale transformation like
\code{<scale x="-1"/>} to the sensor's \code{toWorld} parameter.
