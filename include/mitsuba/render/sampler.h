/**
 * \brief Base class of all sample generators. 
 *
 * For each sample in a pixel, a sample generator produces a (hypothetical)
 * point in the infinite dimensional random number cube. A rendering 
 * algorithm can then request subsequent 1D or 2D components of this point 
 * using the \ref next1D() and \ref next2D() functions. Some implementations
 * make certain guarantees about the stratification of the first n components
 * with respect to the other pixel samples. (the low-discrepancy and 
 * stratified samplers do this for instance). 
 *
 * The general interaction between a sampler and a rendering algorithm is as 
 * follows: Before beginning to render a pixel, the rendering algorithm calls 
 * \ref generate(). The first pixel sample can now be computed, after which
 * \ref advance() needs to be invoked. This repeats until all pixel samples have
 * been generated. Note that some implementations need to be configured for a 
 * certain number of pixel samples, and exceeding these will lead to an 
 * exception being thrown. While computing a pixel sample, the rendering 
 * algorithm usually requests batches of (pseudo-) random numbers using 
 * the \ref next1D(), \ref next2D(), \ref next1DArray() and 
 * \ref next2DArray() functions.
 *
