/* 
   A C-program for MT19937-64 (2004/9/29 version).
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

   This is a 64-bit version of Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number
   generator.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand64(seed)  
   or init_by_array64(init_key, key_length).
