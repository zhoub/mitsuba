/**
 * \brief Abstract parallel particle tracing process
 *
 * This class implements a particle tracer similar to what is
 * described in appendix 4.A of Eric Veach's PhD thesis. Particles
 * are emitted from the light source and subsequently perform a random
 * walk that includes both surface and medium scattering events. The 
 * work is spread out over multiple cores/machines. For every such
 * event,a custom routine is invoked.
 *
 * To actually use this class, you must extend it and implement the
 * function \ref createWorkProcessor(), which should return a subclass
 * of \ref ParticleTracer with overridden functions
 * \ref ParticleTracer::handleSurfaceInteraction and
 * \ref ParticleTracer::handleMediumInteraction.
