\subsection{About Mitsuba}
Mitsuba is an extensible rendering framework written in portable C++. It implements unbiased 
as well as biased techniques and contains heavy optimizations targeted towards current CPU 
architectures.

In comparison to other open source renderers, Mitsuba places a strong emphasis on recent research-oriented 
rendering techniques, such as path-based formulations of Metropolis Light Transport and volumetric
modeling approaches.
