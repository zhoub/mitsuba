\section{Python integration}
\label{sec:python}
A recent feature of Mitsuba is a simple Python interface to the renderer API. 
While the interface is still limited at this point, it can already be
used for simple automation tasks. To access the API, start your Python 
interpreter and run
\begin{python}
import mitsuba
\end{python}
For this to work on MacOS X, you will first have to run the ``\emph{Apple
Menu}$\to$\emph{Command-line Access}'' menu item from within Mitsuba.
On Windows and non-packaged Linux builds, you must update the extension
search path before the \code{import} command is issued:
\begin{python}
import sys

# Update the extension search path
# (may vary depending on your setup)
sys.path.append('dist/python')

import mitsuba
\end{python}
