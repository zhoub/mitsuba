\subsection{Emitters}
\label{sec:emitters}
Mitsuba supports a wide range of emitters/light sources, which can be classified
into two main categories: emitters which are located somewhere within the scene, and emitters
that \emph{surround} the scene to simulate a distant environment. An overview of the available
types is shown below:
